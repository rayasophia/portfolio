# Hash Board Game

A Python-based 2D board game built using hash tables, implementing a minimax algorithm for move evaluation. The game uses object-oriented programming to manage game state and simulate gameplay, with overflow mechanics handled by custom functions. The board is evaluated using a depth-first search approach, and game tree nodes are dynamically generated based on player moves.
