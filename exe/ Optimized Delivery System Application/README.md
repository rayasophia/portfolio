# Optimized Delivery System Application

A C-based solution for a local delivery company, designed to manage multiple trucks and routes for package delivery. The system optimizes delivery logistics, ensuring efficient route planning and truck management. The solution also includes several test scripts written in C++ for validation and testing. These scripts were integrated into the system's CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment. The project was collaboratively developed using Jira (Scrum and Kanban) for project management, GitHub for version control, and Git hooks for automation.
